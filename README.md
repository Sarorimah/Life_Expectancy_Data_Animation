## How I created This


    In this project, you will visually analyze the Gapminder Dataset.


        set up a project folder

        create your own branch in a joint git repository

        read gapminder data into pandas

        draw a histogram with pandas

        draw a scatterplot with matplotlib

        create an animated scatterplot â€“ like the one by [Hans Rosling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo&feature=youtu.be).

        upload your code to GitHub
